# polyglot-livestream
A web MVP of a multi-lingual livestream. Takes in one livestream feed, and output multiple new livestreams with slightly delayed dubbing, hopefully as close to user's original voice profile. Hopefully train on their voice on the dubbed language if the user already can speak that language.
